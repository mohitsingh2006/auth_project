1) Create a login function in Auth Controller which will show our login form.
2) Now we will create login.php view in views folder, here we will create a login form. Again we will use bootstrap to create a login form.
3) In previous video I have used md5 that is outdated I think we need to fix this and use password hash for better security.
4) Now we will create function checkUser in Auth_model which will check a record based on email(username).
5) Now we will modify our login method for user authentication.
6) After checking authentication we will redirect user to dashboard page.
7) We will create a dashboard page.
8) Now we will create a logout function which logout a user.
9) We will create a authorized function in Auth_model which will check if user is authorized to access dashboard.
10) If user is already logged in he/she can not see login or register page.
